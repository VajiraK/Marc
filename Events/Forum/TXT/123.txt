	Yep, and do mention how much battery life u had left at the end.

	Pinibindu -> Keep searching till you come across maximum number of YELLOW packs while keeping an eye on the battery life... :)

dumrat -> 40 000 - 50 000 units

	Hi TOP SCORED GUYS! Can you let us have your robots (executables) so we can check how they performe?

	40000 - 50000 in every batch 13 map, or as an average. I don't think that b13-m1 for example allowed a battery life save of 40000 - 50000. The starting point is so far away. But in b13 - m2, m3, m4, and perhaps even in m5, u maybe right.

	Yeah.. it is the average.. You are correct.. If I remember properly second map had only 23000 units left.

	you guys are picking only yellow packs? or consider about other packs?

and in batch 13, am i correct if i say that your bots move to the left than right? 	
		
		rukshan	2007-04-02 10:54:07
	
	Obviousely you should give priority to the yellow packs. But should consider the others too.

Well.. I can't say exactly which way it moved most.. But what you are thinking is correct.. bot should be lucky to move in the direction where you find most of the yellow packs
