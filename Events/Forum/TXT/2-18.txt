Hi MARC

At the beginning of my program I retrieve the battery life and I kept decrementing the count in every action. At the end of the program I print this battery count left. But what shows on the SpaceShip UI is higher than my count.

I double checked my code and nothing wrong in it. Is there anything wrong in the MARC documentation on battery consumption?.

Please help.

	Oops..!. I can observe this only for the 5th map of 8th batch run - FYI

	Open source the API code for public scrutiny

	OK, If the MARC guys agrees to do so I will do it after the competition is over :) .

Happy training your robot...


Hello,

Make this an anual event.

	Well.. Yeah maybe but it would have to be of a very different nature. Or there's no point..!

	Within next week. Cast your vote on the deadline poll.


Dear Marc guys during the Batch Run 7 the points I received was 0. So I down loaded the Batch 7 maps and run my program. But I received 163 points. What could be wrong?

	Please tell me how did you find the initial battery power for each map?

Happy teaching your robot....

	If you have used any random decisions in your robot then that's perhaps the case. However sometimes we do have to make random decisions due to our limited vision. Drawing out a map would be a lot of help. But sometimes it's just luck.

	Yes. Unless your program uses random numbers to take decisions it should behave the same for all runs. IMO the use of random numbers is not a good practice here unless you do some AI.
