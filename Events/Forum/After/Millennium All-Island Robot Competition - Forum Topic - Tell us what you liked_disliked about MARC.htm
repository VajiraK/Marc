Just that someone organized such a competition itself is something I liked very much.<br />The challenge itself was refreshing and enjoyable. Not the usual \"Find the best algorithm\" type of problem we normally see. And the Spaceship program that was available for download was one of the main factors which kept us coming back again and again to the challenge.<br />I really would have liked it very much if there was a technical forum associated with the site which would have in turn fueled much discusions among the competitiors (Hopefully). <br />The times taken to do the evaluations were too long, yes.<br />The prizes were one of the main factors keeping the competitiors at their computers. However I think that mot of the guys who competed did it out of their genuine interest in this sort of thing rather than the money.(At least initially before you start to think that you\'ve actually got a shot at this.). But prizes were necessary.<br />I think just a little more publicity would have gone a long way in making the competition much fierce, which in turn would have been good overall.<br /><br /><br />', '2007-06-16 15:10:59'],[865, 'vajeemarc', 'I think in overall the competition was a success. You gays have given us a wonderful time and opportunity. Though it was not seen obviously, there was an immense competition among the top 10. I think all have worked to the last second to get the best out of there robots I personally am. Each one may looked at the mission in there unique way it create wonderful strategies for each problem (Like saving Bat, Exchanging pack, Finding way etc..) <br />This is pure strategic creativity and our passion for the programming, that\'s the talent among top ten. So it\'s vastly worthy if marc gays give us a very help full hand for our future career development by evaluating us.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />', '2007-06-17 12:30:28'],[866, 'vpj', 'I agree with dumrat and vajeemarc. It was a wonderful competition, which required innovation and creativity.', '2007-06-17 15:11:40'],[867, 'bomsoft124', 'MARC was simply the best competition I ever took place. I hope MIT will have much more from the Sri Lankan Programming Community than the others because of their understanding of the community needs. For example, MARC had some great innovative and useful talent picked up from the best of all. But there seems to be a little less of participation in the Under-19 (Schools) Category. The Grand Finale event was fabulous, and everyone seemed to be enjoying their presence. Giving us transport was also a great idea too. It made everyone feel that they are valued by the organizers.<br /><br />Prizes was also one of the great things that kept everyone busy at their computers. Cheers !!!<br />The API and all the softwares were also nice.<br />It will be of great value if MIT would give us a hand in our future carreer developments.<br />I think everyone above has written more than what I have to write. They all have some nice points highlighted.<br /><br />And I have a suggestion too. That is to interview each participant of their code and methodology and ask the winners to explain their strategy to the others. It will make everyone benefit from the knowledge and talent of the winners. Something like this was done in the Young Computer Scientist competitions, which I took place and became the runner-up in the senior category in the previous year.<br /><br />I Wish Millennium IT, MARC Team and Everyone took place all the best of luck with their future activities.<br /><br />bomsoft124 - Bhagya Nirmaan (bhagyasilva124@gmail.com)<br /><br />Cheers!!! and Congratulations.
